i wish i could gain the courage to tell these people how i feel i wish i wasnt afraid to know how they will react or what they will say or think,fear

i feel so helpless and i can barely take watching it anymore,fear
i have spent most of the semester feeling very timid but i have recently decided that i just dont give a fuck,fear

im not yet feeling terrified of failing i honestly feel like im overconfident right now because i believe that ive done my best,fear
i now feel extremely intimidated but hope they like my extreme beginner and somewhat juvenile handmade gifts,fear
i grabbed her tugging her forward her ghastly face inches from mine i had to bend down i could feel her shaky breath,fear

i am feeling very intimidated about this whole thing,fear
i feel reluctant to answer the phone,fear
